This weeks was mainly getting grips on what i have learnt using freeCodeCamp and Execute. The project ran smoothly as intended. Everyone had set tickets.
Working in a team with various skills helped me compound on stuff i had forgotten.

wrapping my head around git and how to deliver product in team using version control was a learning curve. Looking at diffrent teams approach to a problem was intresting to see.
how teams would use async and json objects in there project.


2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
[Learning outcome...]
I would like to revisit some vanilla js and get more practice in writing functions and methods. Working on projects so i can start creating solutions for complex problems.
i had alot of git merging issues as i wasn't exactly use to working from feature branches. Mainly working from the main branch. It was something my re-enforced into my on how to push from locally to remote(github) correctly.
